# Project 5
FYS4150/FYS3150: Project 5 by Eirik Bratli and Elisabeth Christensen

#### Project description:
This project aims to construct an algorithm for simulating the wealth distribution in a closed economy, when allowing pairs of financial agents to trade money through 1e7 transactions as Monte Carlo cycles. Here, we take into account different financial restrictions, such as including a saving parameter, a parameter for probability of interaction with neighbouring agents, and a parameter for the number of times an agent has made transactions. The tails of the wealth distribution can be fitted by the Pareto distribution when we take into account all parameters.
