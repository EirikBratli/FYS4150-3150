#Project 4
FYS4150/FYS3150: Project 3 by Eirik Bratli and Elisabeth Christensen

####Project description:
This project aims to use the Ising model with Monte Carlo simulations and the Metroplois algorithm to calculate phase 
transition in a 2D thermodynamical system. The system can be simulated by both parallelization (using MPI), and non-parallelization
(although this requires more computational time).

####Files included:

  - main.cpp (non parallelised)
  - mainMPI.cpp (parallelised)

  - System.h/cpp
  - Metropolis.h/cpp
  - analytic.py
  - Plotting.py
  - Plot_withMPI.py
